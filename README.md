SublimeRandomCrap
=================

Random Sublime plugin scripts (some experimental).  This is a personal repo of extemely simple plugins that aren't worh creating a repo for, or experimental plugins that may or may not work well.  There is really not much documentation to anything.  Since these plugins are either super basic or experimental, I will not be actively giving support to anyone who stumbles on this, so use at your own risk.  If I am willing to start supporting a plugin here, you will see it moved to its own repo.
